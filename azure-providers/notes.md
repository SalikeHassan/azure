## Azure Providers for Terraform

### Available Providers
- **AzureRM**: The primary provider for managing Azure resources.
- **AzureAD**: Used for managing Azure Active Directory resources.
- **Azure DevOps**: Manages Azure DevOps projects, repositories, pipelines, and more.

### Authentication Types
- **Service Principal with Client Secret**:
  - Requires `client_id`, `client_secret`, `tenant_id`, and `subscription_id`.
- **Service Principal with Client Certificate**:
  - Uses a certificate instead of a client secret for authentication.
- **Managed Service Identity (MSI)**:
  - Utilizes Azure's managed identities for Azure resources, removing the need for explicit credentials.
- **CLI Authentication**:
  - Uses Azure CLI for authentication, convenient for local development.

### Best Practices for Managing Sensitive Information
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information like `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `tenant_id` in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in Terraform files.
- **Azure Key Vault**: Use Azure Key Vault to securely store secrets and access them through Terraform using the Key Vault provider.
- **Terraform Cloud/Enterprise**: Store sensitive information in Terraform Cloud or Enterprise workspaces as environment variables.
