## Required Configuration
To use the Azure provider, the following basic configuration is required:
1. **Azure CLI Authentication** (default and recommended):
   - Ensure you are logged in to Azure using:
     ```bash
     az login
     ```

2. **Service Principal Authentication**:
   - Create a Service Principal:
     ```bash
     az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/<subscription_id>"
     ```
   - Use the `client_id`, `client_secret`, `tenant_id`, and `subscription_id` in the provider block.
